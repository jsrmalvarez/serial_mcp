Hello, this is a Arduino IDE sketch.

For Arduino UNO board. give me a serial control for the board's user LED.

The control behaves like this:

when "led_on\n" is received, set the led on and return "ack\n"
when "led_off\n" is received, set the led off and return "ack\n"
when "get_led\n" is received, return "on\n" if led is on or "off\n" if led is off

- jsrmalvarez
Perfect, it works.

Now let's print a welcome  message at init explaining the usage.

Also, when \n is received print the welcome message.

# branch python_control

- jsrmalvarez

Please create a python_control folder at workspace root.

In that folder put a python script that uses pyserial.

Ad a function to send and print back: will send a string, and a \n and will listen for response messages until a \n is received or a timeout.

Defaults are COM8 at 9600 baud.

- jsrmalvarez

Please separate serial connection establishment in its own function.

- jsrmalvarez

Create methods in #sym:ArduinoSerialControl for the led operations, to abstract the string command used.

For the responses, create an enum with values ERROR, OK, ON and OFF.

All serial responses without error are of the form "ack command_name <value>"

e.g.
for "led_on", the successful response is "ack led_on"
for "get_led", one successful response would be "ack get_led off" to indicate that the led is currently switched off.

This logic is in #file:serial_led_control.ino 

- jsrmalvarez

Let's separate #sym:ArduinoSerialControl class in its own file, and put the main method in a test_serial_control.py file (rename serial_control.py)

- jsrmalvarez
Let's turn #file:test_serial_control.py into a proper pytest so I can run it from vscode UI


# branch rest-api 
- jsrmalvarez
Let's add a backend folder, containing a FastAPI based app exposing endpoints to methods of #sym:ArduinoSerialControl 

- jsrmalvarez
Give me a start.py in backend folder so when I do "python start.py" it starts the backend

- jsrmalvarez
Let's use FastAPIMCP to create a MCP server that automatically exposes the rest api endpoints as tools.

Keep it simple, use
mcp = FastApiMCP(app)
mcp.mount()

# branch main
- jsrmalvarez

Let's generate a README.md file at the root of the folder showing a diagram with the arduino firware connected through serial to the host pc, running a python_control with an api interface and a mcp interface.

Describe each component.

Give instructions to launch the demo:
- Program arduino
- Connect usb cable
- Identify COM port which arduino is connected to (can change between plug ins)
- Install python_control dependencies (pip and requirements)
- Give indications to run tests (beware, the com port must not be in use by backend)
- Install backend dependencies (pip and requirements)
- Launch backend with start.py
- MCP server shall be running at http://localhost:9000/mcp
- At http://localhost:9000/docs there is an iterface to test the endpoints
- Connect to VSCode MCP client using mcp.json
- Send prompts like (Please switch the led on)
