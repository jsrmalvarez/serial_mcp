Hello, this is a Arduino IDE sketch.

For Arduino UNO board. give me a serial control for the board's user LED.

The control behaves like this:

when "led_on\n" is received, set the led on and return "ack\n"
when "led_off\n" is received, set the led off and return "ack\n"
when "get_led\n" is received, return "on\n" if led is on or "off\n" if led is off

Perfect, it works.

Now let's print a welcome  message at init explaining the usage.

Also, when \n is received print the welcome message.

# branch python control

Please create a python_control folder at workspace root.

In that folder put a python script that uses pyserial.

Ad a function to send and print back: will send a string, and a \n and will listen for response messages until a \n is received or a timeout.

Defaults are COM8 at 9600 baud.
